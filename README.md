##Portfolio
My portfolio is a web page designed for future employers to learn about me and my professional qualifications. The project was created using HTML, and CSS. By displaying both images as well as links to my projects, this website showcases what I have done so far in my coding experiences, and the projects I am most proud of. 

##userstory
This website is intended for potential employers to see and understand what my workstyle is like. Employers who want to see what I have done in my learning, can travel to this space, where they will see a list of attributes that define me as well as a project. Finally, they will be able to contact me using the contact form at the bottom of the page. 

##Challenges
When creating this page, some of the challenges I faced were with regards to styling. Although I would like to create my own flair to my portfolio, the styling needed to be clean, and it was sometimes hard to make sure my design kept minimalism in mind.
